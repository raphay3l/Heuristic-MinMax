# Heuristic-MinMax
Design and implementation of API for Connect Four inside the game_api.py. 

Depth-first search and MiniMax algorithms with stepping level of sophistication and heuristic element 
to find optimal play implemented in MinMax Play.py. There are a number of helper functions to calculate game_score.
An implementation of a heuristic element which gives an advantage to a player holding a longer chain of elements is in heuristic_connectfour.
Next,  dfs_maximizing calculates depth-first search for the problem.
MiniMax is calculated in minimax_search function using several helper functions.

Boards.py includes sample board scenarios used for testing the algorithms.
